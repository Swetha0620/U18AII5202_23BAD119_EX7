# Reducing Visual Clutter in Large-Scale Datasets

**Name:** Swetha P  
**Roll Number:** 23BAD119

## Project Overview

This experiment focuses on applying **visual clutter reduction techniques** using R to analyze large-scale social media interaction data. Techniques such as alpha blending, jittering, and aggregation with binning are used to enhance visualization clarity and reveal hidden engagement patterns.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`7.social_media_interactions.csv`) contains user interaction data from social media platforms, including:

- Number of Likes  
- Number of Shares  
- Engagement Score  
- Platform  

The data is used to study engagement behavior and interaction patterns.

## Software and Tools Used

- **R Programming Language**  
- **RStudio**  

**Libraries Used:**
- `ggplot2` – data visualization  
- `dplyr` – data manipulation  

---

## Tasks Performed

- Applied **alpha blending** to reduce overplotting in scatter plots  
- Implemented **jittering techniques** to handle overlapping categorical data  
- Used **aggregation and binning** to summarize dense data regions  

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded the required R libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`).  
2. Imported the social media interaction dataset using `read.csv()`.  
3. Created a standard scatter plot to observe overplotting issues.  
4. Applied **alpha blending** to improve point visibility.  
5. Used **jittering** to separate overlapping data points across platforms.  
6. Implemented **2D binning** to aggregate dense regions of likes and shares.  
7. Visualized all plots for comparative analysis.

## Visualisation Techniques Implemented

- **Standard Scatter Plot:** Baseline visualization  
- **Alpha Blending:** Reduces overlap by adjusting transparency  
- **Jittering:** Prevents point overlap in categorical variables  
- **Aggregation & Binning:** Summarizes dense data regions using bins  

*(The implemented charts are included separately.)*

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how visual clutter reduction techniques significantly improve the readability of large-scale datasets. Alpha blending, jittering, and aggregation with binning help reveal meaningful engagement patterns that are otherwise hidden due to overplotting. These techniques are essential for effective visualization of big data in social media analytics.
